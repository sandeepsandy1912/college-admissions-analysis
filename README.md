# college-admissions-analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the College dataset using R. The project explores data, performs regression modeling, evaluates model performance, and applies transformations to improve model fitting. Below is an end-to-end explanation of the project structure, objectives, methodologies, and findings.

Project Objectives
The main goals of this project are:

1.Data Exploration: To understand the structure and key characteristics of the College dataset.

2.Regression Analysis: Perform simple linear regression to explore relationships between variables.
                       Perform multiple linear regression for better predictive modeling.
                       Variable Selection: Identify the most significant predictors using variable selection techniques.

3.Model Improvement: Apply transformations and advanced techniques to improve model performance.

4.Visualization: Generate meaningful plots to support the analysis and findings.

Findings

Significant Predictors: Outstate, Room.Board, perc.alumni, and Expend have strong associations with graduation rate.

Transformations Matter: Logarithmic and scaling transformations greatly reduced residual errors.

Model Performance: Multiple regression outperformed simple linear regression.
                   Optimal variable selection further improved the model.
